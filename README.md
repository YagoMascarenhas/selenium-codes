## What is Selenium?
Selenium is an open-source suite of tools for automating web browsers. It can be used for testing web applications or for RPA (Robotic Process Automation). Selenium code can be written in Java, Python, C#, Ruby, JavaScript and Kotlin.

More information on Selenium can be found on their [official website](https://www.selenium.dev)
## What is this repository?
This repository is a compilation of scripts using Selenium. I don't expect to use this repository for big projects. Most of the things here are for study, experimentation or to apply RPA to a simple but repetitive tasks. 

All codes are developed to work on Firefox browser. They can be easily adapted to run on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer or Safari by simply changing the WebDriver settings. Some functionalities may be browser-specific. For a detailed description on general or specific functionalities, the [Selenium documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/browsers/) can help.
